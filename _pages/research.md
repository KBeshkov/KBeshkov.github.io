<h4>Topological Data Analysis of large scale neural recordings</h4>

The notion of a neural manifold has become a fundamental component for our understanding of how the brain represents and transforms information. However, truly understanding the structure of a neural manifold is a non-trivial task. For one these manifolds can be highly non-linear and have very high dimension, this often means that simply applying dimensionality reduction to visualize them can very often lead us astray. In my work, I focus on studying the topology of neural manifolds and adapt methods from topological data analysis (TDA) with the goal of overcoming the limitations imposed by the complex interactions of billions of neurons.
